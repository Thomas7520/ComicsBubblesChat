Welcome to the Comics Bubbles Chat mod. This mod allows players to have their messages written in chat over their heads.

When the mod is installed on the server (not mandatory since 1.16.5+), it's possible to create a customizable command, with a message when it's executed.

This mod has been designed to enhance chat immersion, whether for semi-rp, rp or other purposes. (On server side, you can disable render bubbles through blocks.)

You can customize bubble colors, sizes, lifetimes, size limits and the maximum number of bubbles visible on a player.

[If you have any question, suggestions or problem, come on the discord! (FAQ available on discord)](https://discord.gg/xTqj3ZSeH4)
